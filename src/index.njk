	<h2>Built to last</h2>
	<p>Websites. UX Copy. Email systems. Newsletters. Booking flows. Anywhere someone interacts with your business online, I design it to work AND to last.</p>
	<p>Not "work" as in "technically function." Work as in still clear, still fast, still maintainable in six months, a year, five years. After all, unless you love spending on ongoing support, it's you who needs to live with what I make.</p>
	<p>After years working across communications and marketing in two of the UK's fastest-changing industries, I learned one thing above all: most people don't need a rebrand or a complicated marketing strategy. They need their digital infrastructure to do the job for the lowest running costs, and keep doing that for as long as possible.</p>

<section class="pad-bottom cap-width ">
	<h2>Not every project is a fit</h2>
	<p>If your business depends on burning through the planet's resources or if your practices contribute to systemic inequality, we're not a fit. I just can't do my best work for something I don't believe in. But if you're building something you believe in and you want to do it responsibly, we <i>need</i> to talk.</p>

<section class="pad-bottom cap-width separate-above">
	<h2>Where I work</h2>
	<p>I'm a designer and creative marketer based in Folkestone. I work with people and teams in Kent, the South East, and beyond. Most of my work is web design and email marketing for small businesses and creatives who've outgrown the DIY approach. But I'm open to creative direction, SEO, or curatorial work if it's worth doing.</p>
	<p>If you're a business or creative based in Folkestone or the surrounding areas, and you're looking for help and a fresh perspective, I've been waiting (especially) for you.</p>
