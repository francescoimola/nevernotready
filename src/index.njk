    <h1>You've done the hard part.</h1>
    <p>The business exists. And it works!</p>
    <p>
      But you've been so unbelieavably busy that your website still thinks it's
      2020 and your email marketing is thick with dust and cobwebs.
    </p>
    <span class="light">Recognize these roadblocks?</span>
    <p>
      Those marketing campaigns you've been meaning to put some work on keep
      inevitably falling to the bottom of your to-do list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your website, so ambitious and bold at first, now tells an old story about
      who you've become and it's starting to undermine your expertise.
    </p>
    <span class="light">These are exactly the problems I help you solve.</span>

      <h2>I could be talking about figures</h2>
      <p>
        About ROI, features on design magazines, or reviews from Silicon Valley
        founders. But truth is, that's not the conversation I want to have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behind every project I work on is a story about growth and about a gap.
        The gap between one's actual skills (or product) and how that person
        (team or business) presents those skills online. It's a gap in
        communication, and a gap that growth has a tendency to widen.
      </p>
      <h2>What does that have to do with you?</h2>
      <p>
        Maybe you're a consultant whose services evolved. A growing team with
        new talent. Or a charity whose mission got sharper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet the more you grow, the more the story you're telling lags behind.
      </p>
      <p>It's no one's fault. You're on the front line, busy doing the work,
        looking after your customers, and making sure you and your team are
        happy and productive.</p>
      <h2>But here's the thing</h2>
      <p>
        What if your website is chipping away at your hard-earned credibility?
        What if if you're loosing users because of tired marketing tactics?
        You're underselling the impact of your product? Or you're having to
        explain away your services during client calls?
      </p>
      <p>That's when you know you've got a problem.</p>

        <h2>These people got too good for their old marketing</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some people that recognised this gap and finally decided to
          hire me. Some needed email campaigns that they never found time to
          run. Others needed buttery-smooth event planning that reflected their
          reputation. Many needed marketing operations that wouldn't fall apart
          when things got busy.
