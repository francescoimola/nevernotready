	<h2>Built to last</h2>
	<p>Websites. UX Copy. Email strategies. Booking flows. Wherever people come into contact with your business, I
		design it to adapt to your current and future needs. So it will stay clear, fast and maintainable for six
		months, a year, five years. And there's only one way we can do this: by always keeping your time, ongoing costs,
		and resources in mind.</p>
	<p>Because after years working across communications and marketing in two of the UK's fastest-changing industries, I
		learned
		one thing: most people don't need an award-winning agency to rebrand them or set them up with a 17-step
		marketing strategy. They need to stop fragmenting their marketing efforts and make better use of their
		resources. I can help with that.

	<h2>Planet-aware design</h2>
	<p>There is a better way to approach design and marketing. One that puts people and the planet ahead of huge
		profits. Nothing I do is perfect, but I do everything I can to ensure my work is as sustainable and ethical as
		possible. This way, we can achieve great results that benefit both the environment and the people who use what
		we create.</p>

	<h2>Where I work</h2>
	<p>I'm a designer and creative marketer based in Folkestone. I operate globally (on a GMT timezone) but I especially
		love working with people and teams in Kent, the South East,
		and London.</p>
	<p>
		Most of my work with local businesses is web design and email marketing for small businesses and creatives
		who've outgrown
		the DIY approach. I'm also open to creative direction, SEO, or curatorial work if it's worth doing.
	</p>
	<p>If you're a business or creative based in Folkestone or the surrounding areas, and you're looking for help, a
		fresh perspective, and someone you can talk to IRL, I've been waiting (especially) for you.</p>
