	<p>I partner with small businesses and freelancers to work both in and on their marketing. As a team of (almost
		always) one, I can be a versatile extension of your team without the agency overheads.</p>

			<h3>Done for you</h3>
			<p>I design, write, and build your website or email campaigns and hand you something simple to maintain. No endless revisions or agency markup</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Consultations</h3>
			<p>Space to figure out the best path forward. We dig into your challenges, the things that are working, those that are not, and the opportunities to simplify.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Guided work</h3>
			<p>We work side-by-side in focused body-doubling sessions to reflect, plan,
				troubleshoot, and make solid progress. New sessions are currently being planned</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Ongoing partnerships</h3>
			<p>For clients who need more than project work, I'm open to ongoing part-time arrangements where we build momentum together over months and years.</p>
