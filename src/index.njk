	<h2>Built to last</h2>
	<p>Websites. UX Copy. Email strategies. Booking flows. Wherever people come into contact with your business, I design it to adapt to your current and future needs. So it will stay clear, fast and maintainable for six months, a year, five years. And there's only one way we can do this: by always keeping your time, ongoing costs, and resources in mind.</p>
	<p>Because after years working across communications and marketing in two of the UK's fastest-changing industries, I learned
		one thing: most people don't need an award-winning agency to rebrand them or set them up with a 17-step marketing strategy. They need to stop fragmenting their marketing efforts and make better use of their resources. I can help with that.

	<h2>Not every project is a fit</h2>
	<p>If your business depends on burning through the planet's resources or if your practices contribute to systemic
		inequality, we're not a fit. I just can't do my best work for something I don't believe in. But if you're
		building something you believe in and you want to do it responsibly, we <i>need</i> to talk.</p>

	<h2>Where I work</h2>
	<p>I'm a designer and creative marketer based in Folkestone. I work with people and teams in Kent, the South East,
		and beyond. Most of my work is web design and email marketing for small businesses and creatives who've outgrown
		the DIY approach. But I'm open to creative direction, SEO, or curatorial work if it's worth doing.</p>
	<p>If you're a business or creative based in Folkestone or the surrounding areas, and you're looking for help and a
		fresh perspective, I've been waiting (especially) for you.</p>
