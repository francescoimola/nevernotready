  <h1>You've done the hard part.</h1>
  <p>The business exists. And it works!</p>
  <p>
    But you've been so unbelieavably busy that your website still thinks it's
    2020 and your email marketing is thick with dust and cobwebs.
  </p>
  <span class="light">Recognize these roadblocks?</span>
  <p>
    Those marketing campaigns you've been meaning to put some work on keep
    inevitably falling to the bottom of your to-do list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your website, so ambitious and bold at first, now tells an old story about
    who you've become and it's starting to undermine your expertise.
  </p>
  <span class="light">They're exactly the problems I help solve.</span>

      <h2>I could be talking about figures</h2>
      <p>
        About ROI, design awards, or reviews from Silicon Valley founders. But
        truth is, that's not the work I do or the conversations I want to have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind every project I work on is a story about growth and about a gap.
        The gap between one's actual skills (or product) and how that person
        (team or business) presents those skills online. It's a gap in
        communication, and a gap that growth has a tendency to widen.
      </p>
      <h2>What does that have to do with you?</h2>
      <p>
        Maybe you're a consultant whose services evolved. A growing team with
        new talent. Or a charity whose mission got sharper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet the more you grow, the more the story you're telling lags behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's no one's fault. You're on the front line, busy doing the work,
        looking after your customers, and making sure you and your team are
        happy and productive.
      </p>
      <h2>But here's the thing</h2>
      <p>
        What if your website is chipping away at your hard-earned credibility?
        What if if you're loosing users because of tired marketing tactics?
        You're underselling the impact of your product? Or you're having to
        explain away your services during client calls?
      </p>
      <p>That's when you know you've got a problem.</p>

        Here are people that recognised this gap and finally decided to hire me. They needed campaigns they never had time to create. Websites with zero headaches. And marketing systems that wouln't collapse if busy.
