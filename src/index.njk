	<h1>You've done the hard part.</h1>
	<p>
		The business is OFF. THE. GROUND. And it works! But you've been so busy that
		your website still thinks it's 2020 and your newsletter is thick with
		cobwebs.
	</p>
	<h2 class="light">Does this sound familiar?</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Your website, once so bold and ambitious, now tells an old story... who
			you were, not who you've become.
		</li>
		<li>
			That newsletter you've been meaning to put some work into keeps inevitably
			falling to the bottom of your to-do list.
		</li>
		<li>Your marketing is starting to undermine your expertise.</li>

			May your website always be sharp and your to-do list short. Still glad you

			Still here? Fine, here's something to pass the time: go sign up to my

	<h2 class="light">Why here, why now</h2>
	<p>
		Past the 12k active satellites orbiting Earth, somewhere out there in the
		interstellar shorelessness, there's your
		<i>North Star</i>. You've walked this far with it on your compass and
		there's been immense growth since.
	</p>
	<p>Everything about your business is in place now.</p>
	<p>Or so it seems.</p>
	<p>
		Yet even with all the hard work. All the luck on your side. While you've
		been on the frontline building on your foundations, kneading dough and
		baking those loavesâ€”even then, your story has been lagging behind.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your website slowly chipping away at your hard-earned credibility as you
		spent your marketing budget showering your social media audience
		with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hit and miss</span> content like there's no tomorrow. And your newsletter...
		<i>which</i> newsletter?
	</p>
	<p>
		It might be hard to put a finger on how. But we can turn this
		around.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's no formula for garanteed success, we both know it, but there are
		ways to increase your odds and I know a couple. Let me take care of them.
