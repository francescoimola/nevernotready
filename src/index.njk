    <h1>You've done the hard part. The business exists! And it works!</h1>
    <p>
      But you've been so busy that your digital presence hasn't kept up with who
      you've become. Your website still thinks it's 2020 and your newsletter is
      covered in cobwebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's get your online self caught up with the person who's out there
      crushing it. No jargon, no convoluted systems that need a developer every
      time you want to change a comma. Just a website and emails that feel like
      you, the real you that exists now.
