    <p>
        Francesco Imola's design and marketing practice. I'm your moustachioed guide to websites you won't drown in, unignorable
        copy, and SEO that doesn't read like a marketing textbook. All at a fraction of agency prices.</p>

<!-- Value Proposition -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>So what?</h2>
    <p>
        Admit it, you deserve a site that actually reflects the business you've grown into. Systems that save you from late-night fiddling hell. And words that make it painfully obvious what you're selling (yet won't make people roll their eyes at LinkedIn guru platitudes).</p>

<!-- About Section -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
        A pretty honest designer and copywriter, I work with small businesses and non-profits who believe that good values and
        good business go hand in hand. I help them test small marketing ideas on the fly. We keep what works and drop what
        doesn't, so we can grow sustainably.
