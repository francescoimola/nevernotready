  <h1>You've done the hard part.</h1>
  <p>
    The business exists. And it works! But you've been so busy that your website
    still thinks it's 2020 and your newsletter is thick with dust and cobwebs.
  </p>
  <h2 class="light">Sounds familiar?</h2>
  <p>
    Those marketing campaigns you've been meaning to put some work on keep
    inevitably falling to the bottom of your to-do list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your website, so ambitious and bold at first, now tells an old story about
    who you've become and it's starting to undermine your expertise.
  </p>
  <h2 class="light">These are exactly the problems I help solve.</h2>

    holding your business back (and what to do about it).

        Every project I work on has the same pattern. Say you're a consultant
        whose services have evolved. A growing team with new talent. Or a
        charity whose mission got sharper
      </p>
      <p class="from-me">mmm, yeah?</p>
      <p class="from-them">
        Way too often, the more you grow, the more the story you're telling lags
        behind
      </p>
      <p class="from-me">I mean sure, but I'm busy running a business here</p>
      <p class="from-them">
        Exactly! It's no one's fault, you're doing the work and marketing can't
        always be the priority.
      </p>
      <p class="from-me">So is it really that big a deal? &#x1F914;</p>
      <p class="from-them" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        It starts to be if your site is chipping away at your credibility. If
        you're loosing users because your marketing's tired. Or you're
        underselling your impact
      </p>
      <p class="from-them">That's when you know you've got a problem</p>

      <h2>These people got too good for their old marketing</h2>

        Here are people that recognised this gap and finally decided to hire me.
        They needed campaigns they never had time to create. Websites with zero
        headaches. And marketing systems that wouln't collapse if busy.
