	<p>I partner with small businesses, solopreneurs and artists to work both in and on their marketing. As a team of (almost
		always) one, I can be a versatile extension of your team without the agency overheads.</p>

		</div>

	<p class="pad-top-lg light">I'm notoriously curious and love learning and getting experimental with <a href="/playground">all kinds of stuff</a>, from community gatherings to exhibitions and most things in between.

	<h2>A different kind of expert</h2>
	<p>I do a stupid amount of things, and what you see on this site is only a fraction of it. Do I spread myself too thin? Maybe. Do I enjoy it? I fucking love it (even though I like to complain).</p>
	<p>At the centre of the work I do is connecting the dots that most people miss.</p>
<p>After years putting on events, turning academic waffle into useful resources for students, and doing brand marketing in one of the UK's most competitive industries, I learned one thing above all: people don't need someone to follow a checklist. They need someone who can spot the story they're not telling, the audience they're ignoring, or the thing that's working against them.</p>

<section class="pad-bottom cap-width ">
	<h2>With a different kind of approach</h2>
	<p>I've honestly watched too many good people pour the heart into doing work that nobody will get to see. The fix is rarely lying in how they're promoting. They've forgotten to look at the whole picture: the product, the pricing, where they're showing up, and yeah, then how they talk about it all.</p>
	<p>We've become obsessed with marketing as promotion, which is convenient because it means we never have to ask harder questions. I'm not afraid to look at the whole picture, even if all you needed was a website. I'm not going to know your industry better than you do, but I will see patterns you're too close to notice. I'll ask questions that feel uncomfortable because they need asking. And I'll help you figure out what actually has a chance of working.</p>

	<h2>Where I work</h2>
	<p>I'm a designer and creative marketer based in Folkestone. I work with people and teams in Kent, the South East, and beyond. Most of my work is web design and email marketing for small businesses and creatives who've outgrown the DIY approach. But I'm open to creative direction, SEO, or curatorial work if it's worth doing.</p>
	<p>If you're a Folkestone business, freelancer, or creative looking for help and a fresh perspective without the agency overheads, I've been waiting for you.</p>
