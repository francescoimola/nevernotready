## Do prices change based on project size?

Smaller projects may sometimes take longer to set-up and coordinate relative to the amount of content produced. Larger projects, by contrast, can allow me to work more efficiently once I'm familiar with the content and context, resulting in less friction.

Here is how the scale of a project affects rates:

- Web design: Pricing per page can decrease according to the project size and complexity. A small site with a couple of pages will be quoted at a higher rate per page than a larger website with many pages that all share a common layout.

- Copywriting and editing: Cost per word can drop as volume of words increases. The percentage decrease ranges from about 10% to a maximum of 30%. The exact figures vary based on the project nature.

- Email marketing: The number of emails, segments or automations affects the price. If I'm producing three editions of a newsletter to launch a new product, I'll price them individually. On the other hand, for larger multi-email campaigns with automation/segments, I'm likely to offer a bulk rate because it's more efficient to work with a familiar setup or more content at once.

- Other marketing and design services: No two projects are the same. But as a rule of thumb, larger projects with lots of research, multiple channels or a series of revisions baked in may cost more overall, but the cost per element (such as per design or consultation) is likely to decrease as the volume of work increases.

## Do you offer concessions? {#concessions}

I understand project fees can be a lot to take in. Rest assured, most of the work I do is carried through to generate returns for your business. This means the result should make you money, rather than cost you money, and will typically pay for itself.

I'm always open to discussing options and finding a pricing structure that fits, especially for businesses engaged in social justice with tighter budgets. And if you're struggling financially, I'd be happy to chat payment plans, whatever the nature of your business.

Below are some of the discounts I offer to all clients:

- Split it in 3: All invoices over £750 can be paid in 3 easy instalments at 0% interest.
- Pay on time: Get a 5% discount is available for payments made within 5 days of the invoice date.
- Pay early: Get a 10% discount if you pay your invoice in full before the work is carried out.

## Are meetings free?

If you need specific help with generating ideas or finding a solution to a problem you're having, this will be a chargeable consultation—unless this meeting was already quoted as part of your project.

A consultation won't simply be an informal chat. It's a call I'll do some preparation for, so I can provide you with valuable ideas and options that will help you move forward.

One hour consultations start at £45, with the final price depending on the amount of pre-planning required.

## How do you quote projects?

I prepare quotes using the information you share with me throughout our initial interactions. This includes the insights gained in our introductory call and the details you'll provide in the briefing questionnaire I'll send you.

The quote sets the scope of the project and gives you a fixed price. This price includes all work in the quote. Each project also includes at least one round of revisions so you can make any necessary changes.

Providing the brief and project scope remain unchanged, the quoted price is all you will pay. Each quote is valid for one month from the date it’s provided.

## Can you work to a deadline?

The work I can deliver by a deadline depends on the size and scope of your project/request(s).

I'm committed to doing quality work, and meeting deadlines often hinges on on how early I'm brought into a project plus my client backlog. Rest assured, I'll do my best to accommodate your needs, no matter how busy.

## What if I'm worried about email overload?

I'm flexible about how to keep in touch during a project. If you're worried about missing emails, or maybe you flinch at the very thought of following up on something that was said four emails ago, I got you.

I can set up private Slack and Trello boards for real-time progress and communication at no extra cost. And if email works for you, great! Your project, your choice.

## Can we meet in person?

Why not! I'm always up for meeting clients face to face.

I'm based in Folkestone, England, so you'll need to be able to get here. I'm happy to meet you for either our intro chat or kick-off meeting anywhere in town or nearby when our schedules coincide.
