	<h2>You've done the hard part.</h2>
	<p>
		The business is off the ground. And it works! But you've been so busy that
		your website still thinks it's 2020 and your newsletter is thick with
		cobwebs.
	</p>
	<p>Sound familiar?</p>
	<p>Here's where I come in: I'll help you</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Turn your bloated website into a business card with superpowers, and that you can finally update without a
			Master's.</li>
		<li>Reclaim lost days spent making reels no one watches, and get you set up with an email marketing strategy
			that perfectly fits your schedule.</li>
		<li>Stop feeling sorry for your marketing, and starts seeing results.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 class="light">Simple is nearly always better</h2>
	<p>You've bult a proper business. You've got customers, reviews, a van, a schedule crammed full, maybe even a waiting list.</p>
	<p>So why does your marketing feel broken?</p>
	<p>
		While you've been running things, your website's gotten stale and your marketing budget's going to content that barely works.
	</p>
	<p>You're exhausted. Staring at the ceiling. What more should I do?</p>
	<p>Nothing more. You need LESS. You need someone to strip away what's not working and leave you with something you can maintain and grow without
		burning out.</p>
