<!-- Intro -->
<section class="section">
    <h1>Making mailing lists do the impossible</h1>
    <p>
        Unignorable newsletters and pretty good email marketing
        <i>*citation needed*</i>. I write the kind of emails your audience can actually relate to. The ones worth opening—not a
            "hope you're well" in sight.

<!-- Values -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Truth in marketing</h2>
    <p class="no-margin-bottom">
        Marketing, when done responsibly, is about connecting people with solutions to their problems. In my work, it also means
        communicating value in the most positive but honest way, without the need for fine print.</p>
</section>
<section class="section">
    <h2>Playing the long game</h2>
    <p class="no-margin-bottom">Because everything I do puts your business reality and your customers first, I'm better at eliminating headaches and bringing clarity than promising overnight profit. Quality systems over quick fixes.</p>
</section>
<section class="section">
    <h2>Challenging the norm</h2>
    <p class="no-margin-bottom">
        Asking questions helps me understand how to best help each client. Questions make space for better solutions, and real progress happens when we stand in that space open to rethinking old ideas.
