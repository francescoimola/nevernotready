    <h1>Get a site people actually want to visit</h1>
    <p>
      Admit it, you deserve a website that works as hard as you do. A site that
      loads faster than you can say “where's their email”. One that guides
      people straight to what they need. No more going ‘round in circles.

      <div>
        <h3>1. Effortless updates</h3>
        <p>You'll find your site quicker to update than making a pivot table in Excel. Trust me, I've seen people spend more time explaining changes to developers than just doing them themselves. I'll give you simple tools and quick tutorials for exactly what you need. So, when you need to launch that event a week early, you can do it straight away, not whenever your web person gets around to it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>2. Type that doesn't get in the way</h3>
        <p>
            When font choices are off, you can feel it—it all looks a bit out of
            place. Not in my book. Typography, how words looks and feel is always top priority in my design. Great typography helps turn casual browsers into engaged readers and it’s why I carefully work with type to add depth.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>3. Low-impact website, high-impact experience</h3>
        <p>
          Your website will reach more people and perform better by focusing on what
      matters. Less data-heavy videos or battery-draining animations means you
      get a more accessible design that’s also lighter on the planet.

    <h2>How much does a website cost</h2>
    <p>
      Bringing a site to life depends on its scale and the features you need. A
      basic one-pager starts from £400.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general rule, I calculated prices according to how many days a
      project will take to complete, based on a minimum day rate of £175.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also offer non-stackable discounts on payment terms to everyone. For
      more information, please have a look at the <a href="/faqs#concessions">FAQs on concessions.</a></p>
