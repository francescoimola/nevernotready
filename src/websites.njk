  <h2>You deserve a site people actually want to visit</h2>
  <p>A website that's intuitive. Built to guide people, not send them going
    'round in circles. One where they instantly find what they came for, so they trust you more and find your offer a whole lot easier to say yes to.</p>

So when you need to launch that event a week early, you can do it straight away, not whenever your developer gets around to it." },

When typography's done right, visitors tend to stick around long enough to get your message, rather than fighting with tiny text or clumsy spacing." },

  <h2>How much does a website cost</h2>
  <p>
    Bringing a site to life depends on its scale and the level of client involvement. A
    basic one-pager starts from £400.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a general rule, I calculate prices according to how many days a project
    will take to complete, based on a minimum day rate of £175.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also offer non-stackable discounts on payment terms to everyone—see <a href="/faqs#concessions">details about concessions here</a>.</p>
