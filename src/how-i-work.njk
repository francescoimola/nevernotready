	<h2>You've done the scary part</h2>
	<p>The business exists. And it works!</p>
	<p>Great, step two: sort out your marketing. Post daily. Run ads. Network. Be relentless. Chase the algorithm. Buy the course.</p>
	<p>Rinse, repeat, burn out.</p>
	<p>If only there were ways your audience could actually find you, without you having to always fight an algorithm or feeling so stretched thin.</p>
	<p>Good news: there are.</p>

<section class="pop cap-width invert-bg green">
	<h2 class="cap-width">What I can do</h2>
	<p>I can help you untangle the chaos in your marketing, strip away what's not working, and build something you can grow without burning out.</p>
	<p>We start with <a data-cal-link="francescoimola/intro" data-cal-namespace="intro"
				data-cal-config='{"layout":"month_view","theme":"light"}'>a free 30-min call</a>: you tell me what's not working, I tell you if I can help. If we're a fit, we pick ONE thing to tackle first. From there, I can either: do it for you, work on it with you, or help you find clarity.</p>

<section class="pad-bottom pad-top-md pop cap-width">
	<h2>What I won't do.</h2>
	<ul class="plain-list">
		<li>• Promise to "transform your brand"</li>
		<li>• Double your revenue in 90 days</li>
		<li>• Give you cookie cutter advice</li>
		<li>• Push you to do more than you can handle</li>
		<li>• Lock you into a long-term retainer</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Before I build anything</h2></p>
	<p>We always work with your resources and your long-term journey in mind. That's how you get results built for where you're going, not just where you are.</p>
	<p>Can you actually maintain this? Will this website structure work when you add new services? Will the copy still make sense a year from now? How will your newsletter scale? How will advancements in AI affect what we've built?</p>
	<p>The way an architect would, we start from the foundations rather than the interior design. Renewable-energy hosting. A fast, forward-thinking website. Foolproof copy. And a mailing list that people want to read, and that grows with your business. It's not the flashy marketing that gets you awards or magazine features. But it's the boring stuff that matters first.</p>

	<h2>What to expect</h2>
	<p>
		For larger projects—like building a website or a writing a full nurturing campaign—here's a general blueprint of how we'll work together. Smaller engagements like consultations are much more intuitive and flexible.
	</p>

	<div class="side-by-grid pad-top-lg">
		<div>
			<h3>1. Discovery</h3>
			<p>
				Once we've introduced each other and mapped out a timeline, we'll dig into the research to understand what your audience needs, and to what's necessary to move forward.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div>
			<h3>2. Collaboration</h3>
			<p>
				We've established goals, it's now time to create the blueprint: I'll draft initial concepts for your review, then I'll refine them based on feedback until we land on something that feels right.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div>
			<h3>3. Production</h3>
			<p>
				This is where it gets real. Whether it's designing a website, creating an email campaign, or some other deliverable, I'll bring everything together and present it to you before we hit "go".
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div>
			<h3>4. Launch & support</h3>
			<p>
				Once everything is live or delivered, I'll make sure things are running smoothly. For ongoing projects, this might mean monitoring performance and making adjustments as needed.
			</p>
		</div>
