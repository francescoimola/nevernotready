	<h2>You've done the scary part</h2>
	<p>The business exists. And it works!</p>
	<p>Great, step two: sort out your marketing. Post daily. Run ads. Network. Be relentless. Chase the algorithm. Buy the course.</p>
	<p>Rinse, repeat, burn out.</p>
	<p>If only there were ways your audience could actually find you, without you having to always fight an algorithm or feeling so stretched thin.</p>
	<p>Good news: there are.</p>

	<h2 class="cap-width">What I can do</h2>
	<p>I can help you untangle the chaos in your marketing, strip away what's not working, and build something you can grow without burning out.</p>
	<p>We start with a free 30-min call. You tell me what's not working, I tell you if I can help. If we're a fit, we pick ONE thing to tackle first.</p>
	<p>From there, I can:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Do it for you</b></li>
		<li><b>Work on it with you</b></li>
		<li><b>Help you find clarity</b></li>
	</ol>
	<div class="buttons-wrapper pad-top-md">
		<a href="/services" class="button-like invert">Explore services & pricing</a>
		<a href="/portfolio">See portfolio</a>

	<h2>What I won't do</h2>
	<ul class="plain-list">
		<li>• Promise to "transform your brand"</li>
		<li>• Double your revenue in 90 days</li>
		<li>• Give you cookie cutter advice</li>
		<li>• Push you to do more than you can handle</li>
		<li>• Lock you into a long-term retainer</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="pad-top-md">Rather than aiming for something massive and overwhelming that will fall apart the moment you take a week off, we work with the time, energy, and budget you've got, and build something sustainable from there.</p>

	<h2>What to expect</h2>
	<p>
		For larger projects—like building a website or a writing a full nurturing campaign—here's a general blueprint of how we'll work together. Smaller engagements like consultations are much more intuitive and flexible.
	</p>

	<div class="side-by-grid pad-top-lg">
		<div>
			<h3>1. Discovery</h3>
			<p>
				After we got to know each other and mapped out a timeline, we'll dig into research, explore what your audience needs, and gather everything necessary to move forward.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div>
			<h3>2. Collaboration</h3>
			<p>
				Once we have a clear direction, I'll design or draft initial concepts for your review. I'll refine the work based on your feedback until we land on something that feels right.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div>
			<h3>3. Production</h3>
			<p>
				Whether it's building a website, finalizing email templates, or preparing deliverables, I'll bring everything together and present it for your feedback before we finalize.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div>
			<h3>4. Launch & support</h3>
			<p>
				Once everything is live or delivered, I'll make sure things are running smoothly. For ongoing projects, this might mean monitoring performance and making adjustments as needed.
			</p>
