	<h2>The one problem I'm here for</h2>
	<p>You've done the scary part. The business exists. And it works!</p>
	<p>Great, step two: sort out your marketing. Post daily. Run ads. Network. Be relentless. Chase the algorithm. Buy the course. Rinse, repeat, burn out.</p>
	<p>It's in the name of the game, you tell yourself.</p>
	<p>But whose game?</p>
	<p>You're <i>this</i> close to getting it right. If only there were ways your audience could actually find you—without you having to always fight an algorithm or feeling so stretched thin.</p>
	<p>Good news: there are.</p>

	<h2>What I can do</h2>
	<p>I can help you untangle the chaos in your marketing, strip away what's not working, and build something you can grow without burning out.</p>
	<p>We start with a free 30-min call. You tell me what's not working, I tell you if I can help. If we're a fit, we pick ONE thing to tackle first. Then I:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Do it for you</b> (design, write, build)</li>
		<li><b>Work on it with you</b> (do-it-together sessions)</li>
		<li><b>Help you find clarity</b> (consultations, workshops) </li>
	</ol>

	<h2>What I won't do</h2>
	<ul class="plain-list">
		<li>• Promise to "transform your brand"</li>
		<li>• Double your revenue in 90 days</li>
		<li>• Give you cookie cutter advice</li>
		<li>• Push you to do more than you can handle</li>
		<li>• Lock you into a long-term retainer</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="pad-top">Rather than aiming for something massive and overwhelming that will fall apart the moment you take a week off, we work with the time, energy, and budget you've got, and build something sustainable from there.</p>
