        can bill you this month. So while SEO gurus push for keyword-stuffed
        garbage (people can tell!), my work honors your audience and lets you skip the panic whenever
        Google does... whatever Google does next." },

        engines can rank it higher. It feels dry. Robotic. Almost instantly
        forgettable. But it needn’t be like that, you can make it to Google's
        first page while keeping readers hooked. I’ll show you how." },

        to bring in specialised talent whenever your project needs it." } ] -%}

  <h2>What are your prices?</h2>
  <p>
    No two projects are the same. That's why fees depend on the scale of the project and whether it's a one-off or ongoing collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a general rule, I calculate prices for SEO work according to how many days a project
    will take to complete, based on a minimum day rate of £150.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also offer non-stackable discounts on payment terms to everyone—see <a href="/faqs#concessions">details about concessions here</a>.</p>
