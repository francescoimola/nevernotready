<!-- Intro -->
<section class="section">
    <h1>SEO that won't read like a marketing textbook</h1>
    <p>
        Making the search engine gods smile upon your website with content people actually want to read. I'll handle the technical stuff too, like making your site more accessible—which, fun fact, help your rankings.

<!-- Values -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>No more boring content</h2>
    <p class="no-margin-bottom">
        You know it when you see it: that blog post written just so daddy Google can rank that page higher. Frankly, they always read kind of dry and robotic, but it needn't be like that—I can show you how.
    </p>
</section>
<section class="section">
    <h2>Asynchronous first</h2>
    <p class="no-margin-bottom">
        Limiting synchronous work such as meetings lets me deliver great results without sacrificing work-life balance. Plus, working remotely means I can bring in external talent and expertise whenever needed.
    </p>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Playing the long game</h2>
    <p class="no-margin-bottom">Because everything I do puts your business reality and your customers first, I'm better at eliminating headaches and bringing clarity than promising overnight profit. Quality systems over quick fixes.</p>
