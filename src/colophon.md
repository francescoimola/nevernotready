## About

This website closer resembles a giant Venn diagram rather than a portfolio site. You can expect to find a mix of things, including services I offer, events I run, and thing I'm working on. I update it as often as I can to reflect the flow of my current practice. There will probably be some design tweaks here and there as I update it.

## Technical

I built this website myself. Its code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/francescoimola/nevernotready.git). It's built with 11ty and deployed by Netlify. Early in the process, I forked its foundations from an 11ty template, although the current site and backend look nothing like the template.

The design was drafted directly on the webpage using VS Code. Pages are written either in Nunjucks or Markdown. I do not currently collect user analytics data, although this might change as I plan to implement a blog. My domain francescoimola.com is registered with Hover.

This website was previously two websites, I used to have a container for everything business-related, and one for everything else. I have since recognised the value of my multidisciplnary practice and have redesigned this site to accomodate more of what I do and have to share.

## AI use

This site was created and is maintained by a single person. To improve the reliability of code, fix bugs, and edit text, I occasionally used Claude by Anthropic and ChatGPT by OpenAI. AI tools came into the picture because professional editing or development support wasn’t financially possible (at the time of writing). But at all design and final decisions remain human-made, i.e. mine.

The use of LLMs carries a carbon footprint. While this site’s code is efficient and powered by renewable energy, I acknowledge that such measures won't erase the environmental cost of using AI in the first place.
