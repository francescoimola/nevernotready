## About

This website closer resembles a giant Venn diagram rather than a portfolio site. You can expect to find a mix of things, including services I offer, events I run, thing I'm working on, etc. I update this website as often as I can to reflect the flow of my current practice. There will probably be some design tweaks here and there as I update it.

## Technical

I built this website myself. It's source code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/francescoimola/nevernotready.git). I built it with 11ty and it's deployed by Netlify. Early in the process, I forked its foundations from an 11ty template, although the current site and backend look nothing like the template now.

The design was drafted directly on the webpage using VS Code, with help from Claude and Chat GPT. Pages are written either in Nunjucks or Markdown. I do not currently collect user analytics data, although this might change as I plan to implement a blog. My domain francescoimola.com is registered with Hover.

This website was previously two websites, everything business-related used to sit at nevernotready.club, and the rest at francescoimola.com. I have since recognised the value of my multidisciplnary practice and have redesigned this site to accomodate more of what I do and have to share.
