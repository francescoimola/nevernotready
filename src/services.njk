  <h2>What I offer and what it costs</h2>
  <p>Imagine marketing that works and feels right. People reaching out to you because they just <i>*get*</i> what you're
    selling.</p>
  <p>Fewer that's-not-what-I-thought-I-was-buying moments and more customers who stay because they feel cared for and
    respected.</p>
  <p>I can help with that.</p>
  <p>Here's a breakdown of my services and pricing.</p>
</section>

<!-- Website Consulting Sessions -->
<section id="consulting" class="pop small-margin">
  <h2>Website consultation</h2>
  <p>Each session is 1 hour and includes a 1-2-1 chat, a pre-session deep dive, a website review, a short questionnaire,
    and follow-up notes.</p>

  <p><br>How we use this time is flexible. We can focus on specific challenges, brainstorm ideas, or plan next steps together.</p>
</section>

<!-- Website Design & Copywriting -->
<section id="website-design" class="pop small-margin">
  <h2>Web Design, Writing & Development</h2>
  <p>You get a website that's intuitive and built to guide people, not send them around in circles. One that helps you
    build trust and makes your offer a whole lot easier to say yes to. You'll be able to update it quicker than making scrambled eggs. Because I'll hand you tools simple enough to do
    exactly what
    you need.</p>

  <div class="pricing-grid pad-top">
    <div class="pricing-row pricing-header">
      <span>What you get</span>
      <span>Investment (from)</span>

</section>

<!-- Email Marketing -->
<section id="email-marketing" class="pop small-margin">
  <h2>Email marketing</h2>
  <p>Emails are the backbone of your marketing. They get your message right to your audience AND you can automate them in the background while you focus on other things. A solid email strategy means sustainable growth over quick wins.
