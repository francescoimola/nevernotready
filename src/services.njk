<!-- Email Marketing -->

  <h2>Email marketing</h2>
  <p>A solid email strategy is the backbone of your marketing. It gets your message right to your audience AND you can automate (most) of it in the background while you focus on the actual work. I can set a system up for you or audit your existing setup and recommend improvements.</p>
