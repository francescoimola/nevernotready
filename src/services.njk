  <h2>What I offer and what it costs</h2>
  <p>Imagine marketing that works and feels right. People reaching out to you because they just <i>*get*</i> what you're
    selling.</p>
  <p>Fewer that's-not-what-I-thought-I-was-buying moments and more customers who stay because they feel cared for and
    respected.</p>
  <p>I can help with that.</p>
  <p>Here's a breakdown of my services and pricing.</p>
</section>

<!-- Website Consulting Sessions -->
<section id="consulting" class="pop cap-width">
  <h2>Website consultation</h2>
  <p>Each session is 1 hour and includes a 1:1 chat, a pre-session deep dive, a website review, a short questionnaire,
    and follow-up notes.</p>
  <div class="pricing-grid">
    <div class="pricing-row pricing-header">
      <span>Sessions</span>
      <span>Investment</span>
    </div>
    <div class="pricing-row">

      <span>£595</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><br>How we use this time is flexible. We can focus on specific challenges, brainstorm ideas, or plan next steps together.</p>
</section>

<!-- Website Design & Copywriting -->
<section id="website-design" class="pop cap-width pad-top-md">
  <h2>Web Design, Writing & Development</h2>
  <p>Get an intuitive website built to guide people, not send them around in circles. A site that helps you
    build trust and makes your offer a whole lot easier to say yes to. Stupid quick to update and look after, no monthly maintenance fees attached.</p>

  <div class="pricing-grid pad-top-md">
    <div class="pricing-row pricing-header">
      <span>What you get</span>
      <span>Investment (from)</span>
    </div>
    <div class="pricing-row">
      <span>Full website with CMS</span>
      <span>£3,500</span>
    </div>
    <div class="pricing-row">
      <span>Static 2-6 page site</span>
      <span>£2,500</span>
    </div>
    <div class="pricing-row">
      <span>One-pager</span>
      <span>£600</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><br>Websites are build either on Framer or Webflow. Each project includes one revision, with more available for an additional fee. You'll get an exact quote before we start.</p>

</section>

<!-- Email Marketing -->
<section id="email-marketing" class="pop cap-width pad-top-md">
  <h2>Email marketing</h2>
  <p>Emails are the backbone of your marketing. They get your message right to your audience AND you can automate them in the background while you focus on other things. A solid email strategy means sustainable growth over quick wins.
  </p>
  <div class="pricing-grid">
    <div class="pricing-row pricing-header">
